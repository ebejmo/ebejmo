I'm Emil from Sweden, and I'm a front-end development student at Noroff - School of development and digital media. I really enjoy creating visually appealing and user-friendly websites. Working with CSS and UX/UI design brings me great joy and satisfaction.


Skills: HTML / CSS / JS / UI / UX

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my portfolio. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript to further expand my programming skills. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: For the past 13 years I have worked as a professional ice hockey player.
