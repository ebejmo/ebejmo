I'm Emil from Sweden, and I'm a front-end development student at Noroff - School of development and digital media. I really enjoy creating visually appealing and user-friendly websites. Working with CSS and UX/UI design brings me great joy and satisfaction.

At the moment I'm delving into the world of JavaScript to further expand my programming expertise. I believe that mastering JavaScript will empower me to build more dynamic and interactive web experiences.

Outside of the tech world, I have another exciting facet of my lifeâ€”I am a professional ice hockey player. Combining my love for sports and technology, I've learned valuable lessons in teamwork, perseverance, and discipline, which I carry with me into every aspect of my life.


Skills: HTML / CSS / JS / UI / UX
